abstract={With the rapid development of emerging applications and data transmission rate in LTE (Long Term Evolution) system, terminal power consumption is becoming seriously. In LTE, the discontinuous reception (DRX) mechanism was taken as an important method of saving energy of terminal. Through operations of all sorts of timers, a detailed analysis of the principle of DRX is introduced in this paper. And based on this, adjustable DRX long cycle is proposed. On the basis of the DRX semi-Markov process and ETSI data model, formulas of power saving factor and wake-up delay for adjustable LTE DRX are derived. Then from the comparisons of fixed frame DRX cycle and adjustable DRX cycle in terms of power saving and wake-up delay, we know that this optimizing mechanism has obvious improvement in the reduction of terminal power consumption.},
